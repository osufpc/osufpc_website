We are just a bunch of people interested in non-traditional (OOP and Imperative)
programming languages. We realize that there are many ways to do computation and
are really just programming languages nerds. If you've ever thought "Wow lisp is
cool" or "Jeeze I wish python had applicatives", or perhaps "What is all this
functional programming jargon, why would anyone ever use this stuff?", then
you'll fit right in.

Likewise we are dedicated to teaching and helping others learn functional
languages. It is jarring the first time you reach out for another programming
paradigm and being the functional programming club the least we can do is offer
our help. We are a mixed bag of experience with members ranging from PhD
students and Candidates, to first year undergraduates, seniors and master's
students. It doesn't matter who you are as long as you bring your curiosity
you'll be at home.

This is the first year that the club has come into existence and we have had
overwhelming support from the school, the programming languages group, and all
of the students that have made it possible, thank you all for your efforts!

Stay functional,

- Jeff
