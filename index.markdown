title: Welcome to the OSU Functional Programming Club
date: 2018-04-28

### What it is
A club that provides a place for computer scientists, programmers, hobbyists or
curious people to discuss, help, create, learn and explore functional
programming. Everyone is welcome, no experience required and all grade levels
are represented.

### What do we do
FPC runs tutorial series on whatever our members are interested in as long as it
relates to functional programming in some form. For example, we've held sessions
and tutorials on: using Haskell as a scripting language, generating
computational music (algorave), and theorem proving in coq, and a deep dive into
using functional programming idioms in Java. We also occasionally hold
hackathons, and code critiques. New topics and suggestions for content come
straight from our members. So if you'd like to dive into something just show up
and suggest it!

### When we meet
**Where**: KEC 1005<br/>
**When**: Every Tuesday @ 4:00 pm

### How to Participate
Participation is voluntary and non-compulsory, you can just show up and start
learning or helping others at any point in the term. We do all our coordination
over the OSU hosted mailing list so make sure you join if you are interested in
coming to an event. Other than that you can hang out with us online by:
